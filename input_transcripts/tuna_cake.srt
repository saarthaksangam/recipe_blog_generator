00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
these quick and easy tuna cakes are

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,560
tender delicious and loaded with flavor

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,000
hi you're watching plating it to Wendy

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,880
where I share with you recipes which

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,599
impress with these these tuna cakes come

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,240
together in minutes so let's get started

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,080
for this recipe we're going to be using

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,920
three cans of solid white tuna if you

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
have flaky tuna handy that would work

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,279
too you could even use salmon if you

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,160
want it for this recipe we're going to

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,960
drain out all the water

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
let's empty the tuner into a bowl and

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,960
we're going to mix all the ingredients

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,360
in this

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
bowl since we're using solid tuner we're

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,800
going to smash it down so that it

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,050
becomes a little bit more

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,870
[Music]

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,320
flaky I think this is looking just right

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,280
to help the tuna cakes bind together

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,879
we're going to be using the breadcrumbs

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,239
of three slices of fresh bread we're

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,480
just going to cut it down so we can put

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,600
it into our little mini chopper and make

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,960
it into

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,840
breadcrumbs I love using fresh

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
breadcrumbs for this recipe because it

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,400
gives the tuna cakes that lovely tender

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,200
texture since the onion is really huge

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,759
I'm going to go in with half an onion

32
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm just going to cut the onion up into

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,040
big bits and then toss it into the

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,240
chopper and chop it up

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,000
fine this is my favorite hack for

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
chopping onions now let's toss the

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,720
onions into the bowl

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,240
for a little spice we're going to be

39
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,100
adding in two green

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,079
[Music]

41
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,240
chilies I'm just going to give this to a

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,439
rough chop and add it to the

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,159
chopper along with the chilies I'm going

44
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,280
to add about five garlic cloves and I'm

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
just going to clean them and add them to

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,759
the

47
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,479
chopper just going to add this along

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,039
with the rest of the

49
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,719
ingredients for that extra EXT ra flavor

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,600
and a pop of color we're going to be

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
adding half a red bell pepper just going

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
to give it a rough chop I'm going to be

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,119
putting this two into the

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,959
chopper now let's tosson the bell

55
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,239
peppers along with the

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,840
rest now to make our tuna cakes nice and

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
moist we're going to be adding in two

58
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Tomatoes but we're going to take out the

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,599
seeds because we don't want them getting

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
too mushy I decided not to put the

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,239
tomatoes into the chopper because it

62
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,360
tends to become a little bit more pasty

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,920
in the chopper I feel that chopping it

64
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
by hand keeps it a little bit more

65
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,480
firm now let's add this to the bowl to

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,640
give our tuna cakes that nice fresh

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,680
flavor we're going to add in a bunch of

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
cantro and we're going to chop it down

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
nice and fine just going to add that in

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,040
with the rest of the ingredients let's

71
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,879
season this up with a juice of half a

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,599
lemon about half a teaspon of Dijon

73
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,920
mustard some salt

74
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,760
and pepper to

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
taste now to bring this all together and

76
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
help it to bind we're going to add three

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
large

78
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,599
eggs we're just going to give the eggs a

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,319
light beet because that's going to make

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,280
it easier for it to mix up to the rest

81
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
of the

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,519
ingredients just going to lightly mix up

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,280
all these ingredients first before we

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,580
add the eggs to

85
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,120
[Music]

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,720
it the burst of all these colors is

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,360
going to make the tuna cakes look so

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
delicious just once they're fried and

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
ready now let's just add the egg

90
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
in we're just going to give this a good

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,040
mix so the egg gets a chance to bind all

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,879
of the ingredients together these tuna

93
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,879
cakes are so delicious and really easy

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,079
to put together they can be prepared

95
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,879
just in time when you want to eat them

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,519
or they can be prepared ahead of time

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,519
too and refrigerated and then had just

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,319
when you need them okay this looks just

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,280
perfect so now let's start forming the

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,319
tuner cakes in a bowl we're going to

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
beat up three eggs we're going to be

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,040
dipping the cakes into the beaten eggs

103
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,920
before we coat it with the bread crumbs

104
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,319
just going to put some breadcrumbs down

105
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,400
on this and I'm going to use a trigger

106
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,919
release ice cream scoop just so that we

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,639
get uniform size of tuna cakes you don't

108
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
need to do it okay so we dipped it into

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,440
the egg and now straight into the bread

110
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
crumbs

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
Now using a knife I'm just going to

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
shape it

113
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:45,880
[Music]

114
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,560
down just going to lift it and keep it

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,730
to one side while we prepare the next

116
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,680
[Music]

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,840
one again into the beaten

118
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,800
egg and then into the bread

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
crumbs coat it well with the breadcrumbs

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,190
all

121
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,360
[Music]

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,490
around just going to form it

123
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,449
[Music]

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,919
again keep it to one side we're going to

125
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,360
be frying these in batches of four so as

126
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,440
soon as you have four prepped add some

127
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,759
vegetable oil to a heated Skillet and

128
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,280
let's fry

129
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,639
them since the only thing that needs to

130
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,600
really cook in these tuna cakes is the

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,039
egg it doesn't take too long to fry as

132
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,840
soon as you find that it's golden brown

133
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,280
in one side you're going to flip it over

134
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,160
and allow it to fry on the other

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
side once they get that lovely golden

136
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,400
color on both sides we're going to lift

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,319
them off the pan and place them in a

138
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,880
plate on a paper towel so that any

139
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,520
excess oil will be absorbed

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,800
now let's plate these crispy tuna

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
cakes and look at

142
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,080
