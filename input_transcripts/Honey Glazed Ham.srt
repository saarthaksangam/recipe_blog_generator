00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
hi and welcome back to Plating It with

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,680
Wendy where we share with you recipes

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,919
which impress with ease as I glaze this

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,759
ham with sweet honey and fragrant spices

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,920
I can already picture it at the center

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,720
of the table ready to bring everyone

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
together now let's get started for this

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,560
recipe we're going to go in with a 10 lb

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
fully cooked smoked ham which is bone in

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,160
and you could either go in for one that

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
is spiral cut but I've opted for one

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
that's not now we're going to take off

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
this vacuum plastic seal and start

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,360
prepping the ham and now we're going to

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
score it so that when we baste it with

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
the glaze the flavor of the glaze goes

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,280
right into the meat if you buy a spiral

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,960
cut ham there's no need to do this

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,160
step and now we're going to do the same

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,920
thing on this side as well

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,039
now that we've scored the ham let's keep

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,000
it aside and prep our baking tray so

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,359
we're first going to go in with some

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,280
pineapple slices at the bottom of the

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,000
tray and this is going to flavor the ham

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,040
and also keep it nice and succulent and

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
now we're just going to start lining it

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,799
up all across the bottom of the tray the

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,600
pineapple slices will also get

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,360
caramelized while the ham is in the oven

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
and then we're going to use them to

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
decorate the dish when we serve the ham

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
we're going to use all this pineapple

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
juice to prepare the glaze but first

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
let's place the ham on top of the

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
pineapple slices and when placing the

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
ham in the baking tray you're going to

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,119
place it cut side down we're just going

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
to toss in some few star into our baking

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,520
dish for some added

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,960
flavor to add some warm flavors to the

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
glaze we're going to be adding 1/4

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,040
teaspoon of ground cloves so we're just

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
going to grind up a few in our motor

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
pristol before we go over to the stove

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,799
and prepare the glaze

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
while preparing the glaze it's a good

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,000
time to preheat your oven to 325° F or

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,040
163° C and to a pot on low heat we're

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
going to add 1/4 cup of unsalted butter

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and now that the butter has melted we're

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
going to add 1 cup of the pineapple

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,399
juice that we had preserved earlier 1

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,959
cup of packed dark brown

55
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,879
sugar and that's how packed you want it

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,160
2 tablebspoon of Dijon mustard and this

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,200
adds a lot of flavor to the glaze half a

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
cup of honey or you could add maple

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,720
syrup if you wanted and for those warm

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
flavors we're going to go in with 1/4

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
teaspoon of the ground cloves 1/4

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg now

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,640
we're going to increase the heat to

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
medium high and we're going to allow

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
this to cook for about 6 to 8 minutes

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
till it thickens make sure that you keep

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
stirring it while you cook it so that it

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
does not stick to the bottom of the pot

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
so it's going to start bubbling up a lot

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
so you've got to keep stirring it and

72
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,319
when cooking ham you don't need to add

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,159
any salt that's why we added the

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
unsalted butter because the pre-cooked

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,239
ham already contains a lot of salt in

76
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,000
it the glaze is beginning to thicken it

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
requires just about another 2 or 3

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,760
minutes to cook before we take it off

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
the heat

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
now this is the consistency you're

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,519
looking

82
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,040
for and it's going to thicken more while

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
it cools so now we're going to take it

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,760
off the heat and we're going to take a

85
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
brush and put it into that lovely glaze

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,159
that we made now from the top we're

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,120
going to start basting it down with the

88
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,400
glaze and you're going to be really

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
generous when doing

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,519
this and you're going to do it all

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
around the ham don't forget to put some

92
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,959
on the top as well here you're going to

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
use up at least one/3 of the glaze that

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,000
you prepare while doing the first

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
basting we're going to base it twice

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,760
more once we have placed it in the oven

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
for the first time to preserve the

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,200
moisture in the ham we're going to

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,840
loosely cover it with an aluminum foil

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
before we place it in our preheated oven

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,680
at 325° F or 160° C

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
and we're going to bake it till the

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,799
internal temperature of the ham reaches

104
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,280
100° F which is approximately 38° C and

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,600
this should take somewhere between 2 to

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
2 and 1/2 hours once the ham has reached

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,639
the desired internal temperature it's

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,639
time to take it out of the oven and

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
remove the aluminum foil and now we're

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
going to baseaste it once again with the

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
glaze that we had made and this time

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
we're going to use half of what is

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,639
remaining and while you're doing this

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
you're going to crank up the heat of the

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,560
oven to 400° F which is approximately

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,000
200°

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,360
C you'll find that the glaze has

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
thickened you could always warm it and

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
thin it out a bit i prefer dabbing on

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,919
the thick glaze this is going to be the

121
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,240
centerpiece at the table now this is

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
going to help caramelize the outside and

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
give it that lovely crispy look now back

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
into the oven this goes for 10 minutes

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
then we'll take it out and baste it one

126
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,280
more

127
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,199
time it's been 10 minutes so now it's

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
time for us to baste it one more time

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,440
and now we're going to use up all the

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
remaining glaze to baste it the second

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,639
time you're going to try to get it

132
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,600
between all those cuts that we had made

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
so that the flavor goes into the

134
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,440
ham just going to use the brush and pat

135
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,080
it down very gently now let's put some

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
at the back don't forget the top portion

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400
you want the flavor all over now back

138
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
into the oven this goes uncovered for

139
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,360
another 10

140
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,919
minutes our ham is ready but not so

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
ready you've got to let it rest for at

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,000
least 30 minutes before you carve it wow

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
look at all that pineapple in the bottom

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
it's so full of flavor and we're going

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
to be using them when we plate the ham

146
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,919
and all those drippings that are down in

147
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
the pan we can put it into a gravy bowl

148
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
and keep it at the side of the ham so

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
that if anybody wants to pour it on the

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
top of the slice they can always do that

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
because it's loaded with flavor oh my

152
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
goodness look at that and now it's time

153
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
to give the ham a taste and I'm so

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,039

155
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,759
