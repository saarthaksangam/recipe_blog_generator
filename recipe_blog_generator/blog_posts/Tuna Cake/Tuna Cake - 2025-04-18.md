## Ingredients

### For the tuna cake mixture
- 3 cans solid white tuna (5 oz/142g each), drained (flaky tuna or canned salmon also work)
- 3 slices fresh bread, crusts removed (for breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion, finely chopped
- 2 green chilies, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, finely minced
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, seeds removed and diced
- 1 small bunch cilantro, finely chopped (about ½ cup packed)
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

### For coating the cakes
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- Fresh breadcrumbs (from about 2-3 more slices of bread, or use store-bought)
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Ingredients
- Drain the canned tuna well and place it in a large mixing bowl. If using solid tuna, break it up with a fork until flaky.
- Cut the bread into pieces and pulse in a mini chopper or food processor to make fresh breadcrumbs.
- Finely chop the onion, green chilies, garlic, red bell pepper, and cilantro. Dice the tomatoes by hand (remove seeds to prevent sogginess).
- Add all chopped veggies and herbs to the tuna.

### 2. Mix the Tuna Cake Mixture
- Add the fresh breadcrumbs, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt, and black pepper to the bowl.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and add them in.
- Gently mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be moist but hold together when shaped.

### 3. Shape and Coat the Tuna Cakes
- Use an ice cream scoop or your hands to portion out the mixture into even-sized balls.
- Flatten each ball gently to form cakes.
- Beat 3 more eggs in a shallow bowl for coating.
- Place breadcrumbs for coating in another shallow dish.
- Dip each tuna cake first into the beaten egg, then into the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to coat all sides.

### 4. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
- Once hot, add tuna cakes in batches (about 4 at a time—don’t overcrowd the pan).
- Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crisp.
- Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.

### 5. Plate and Serve
- Arrange the crispy tuna cakes on a platter.
- Serve hot, garnished with extra cilantro or a squeeze of lemon, if desired.
