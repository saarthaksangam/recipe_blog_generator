## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cakes
- 3 cans solid white tuna (drained; flaky tuna or canned salmon also work)
- 3 slices fresh bread (for breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion
- 2 green chilies
- 5 garlic cloves
- ½ red bell pepper
- 2 medium tomatoes (seeds removed)
- 1 small bunch cilantro (finely chopped)
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs (lightly beaten, for binding)

### For Coating and Frying
- 3 large eggs (beaten, for coating)
- 1–2 cups fresh breadcrumbs (as needed for coating)
- Vegetable oil (for frying)

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Tuna Mixture
- Drain the canned tuna thoroughly and transfer to a large mixing bowl. If using solid tuna, break it up with a fork to a flaky consistency.
- Make fresh breadcrumbs by pulsing 3 slices of bread in a mini chopper or food processor.
- Add the breadcrumbs to the bowl with the tuna.

### 2. Prepare and Add Vegetables
- Roughly chop ½ onion, 2 green chilies, and 5 garlic cloves. Pulse together in the chopper until finely minced.
- Add the onion, chilies, and garlic to the tuna mixture.
- Roughly chop ½ red bell pepper and pulse until finely chopped; add to the bowl.
- Remove seeds from the tomatoes and chop finely by hand (to avoid excess moisture); add to the mixture.
- Finely chop a small bunch of cilantro and add.

### 3. Season and Bind
- Add juice of ½ lemon and ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard to the bowl.
- Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and add to the mixture.
- Gently mix everything until evenly combined and the mixture holds together.

### 4. Shape and Coat the Tuna Cakes
- Beat 3 eggs in a separate bowl (for coating).
- Place additional fresh breadcrumbs in a shallow tray.
- Using a scoop or your hands, portion the tuna mixture into equal-sized balls. Flatten gently to form cakes.
- Dip each cake first into the beaten eggs, then coat well with breadcrumbs on all sides. Set aside on a tray.

### 5. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
- Fry the cakes in batches of four, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
- Cook 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crisp.
- Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
