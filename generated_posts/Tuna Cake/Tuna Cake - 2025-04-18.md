## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cakes
- 3 cans solid white tuna (drained; flaky tuna or canned salmon also work)
- 3 slices fresh bread (for breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion, finely chopped
- 2 green chilies, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, seeds removed and diced
- 1 small bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

### For Coating & Frying
- 2–3 cups breadcrumbs (for coating)
- 3 large eggs, beaten (for dipping)
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Tuna and Veggies
- Drain the tuna well and add it to a large mixing bowl. Use a fork to break it into flakes if using solid tuna.
- Tear the fresh bread slices into pieces and pulse in a mini chopper or food processor to make soft breadcrumbs.
- Add the breadcrumbs to the tuna.
- Finely chop the onion, green chilies, garlic cloves, and red bell pepper (use a chopper for ease). Add all to the bowl.
- Dice the deseeded tomatoes by hand and add to the mixture.
- Finely chop the cilantro and add it in.

### 2. Season and Bind the Mixture
- Add the juice of half a lemon, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper to taste.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and add them to the bowl.
- Mix everything thoroughly until well combined. The mixture should hold together when pressed.

### 3. Shape and Coat the Tuna Cakes
- Place additional breadcrumbs in a shallow dish and beat 3 eggs in a separate bowl for coating.
- Using a trigger-release ice cream scoop or your hands, portion the tuna mixture into uniform patties.
- Dip each patty into the beaten eggs, then coat well with breadcrumbs. Shape with your hands or a knife if needed. Set aside on a tray.

### 4. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat about ¼ inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
- Once hot, add tuna cakes in batches (about 4 at a time).
- Fry for 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook the other side.
- Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.

### 5. Serve and Enjoy!
- Plate the hot, crispy tuna cakes.
- Serve with your favorite dipping sauce, salad, or as a sandwich filling.
