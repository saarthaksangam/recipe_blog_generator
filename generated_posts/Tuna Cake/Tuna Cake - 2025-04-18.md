## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cake Mixture
- 3 cans solid white tuna, drained (flaky tuna or canned salmon can also be used)
- 3 slices fresh bread, crusts removed (for fresh breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion, finely chopped
- 2 green chilies, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, seeds removed and diced
- 1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

### For Coating and Frying
- 3 large eggs, beaten (for dipping)
- 1–1½ cups fresh breadcrumbs (for coating)
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Tuna Mixture
- Drain the tuna well and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Flake it apart with a fork.
- Prepare fresh breadcrumbs by pulsing the bread slices in a mini chopper or food processor. Add to the bowl with tuna.
- Finely chop the onion, green chilies, garlic, and red bell pepper (using a chopper for ease). Add to the bowl.
- Dice the tomatoes by hand (removing seeds first to prevent excess moisture) and add to the mixture.
- Chop cilantro finely and add in.
- Season with lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and add to the mixture. Mix everything together until well combined and the mixture holds its shape.

### 2. Shape and Coat the Tuna Cakes
- In a separate bowl, beat 3 eggs for dipping.
- Place fresh breadcrumbs in another shallow dish for coating.
- Using a scoop or your hands, form the tuna mixture into patties (about 2–3 inches in diameter).
- Dip each patty first into the beaten egg, then coat evenly with breadcrumbs. Place on a tray while you prepare the rest.

### 3. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
- Fry the tuna cakes in batches (about 4 at a time), cooking 2–3 minutes per side or until golden brown and crispy.
- Transfer the cooked cakes to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.

### 4. Serve and Enjoy
- Arrange the crispy tuna cakes on a platter.
- Garnish with extra cilantro or lemon wedges if desired.
