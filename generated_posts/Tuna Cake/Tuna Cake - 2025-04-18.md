## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cakes
- 3 cans solid white tuna (5 oz/142 g each), drained *(flaky tuna or canned salmon work too!)*
- 3 slices fresh bread, crusts removed (for breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion, finely chopped
- 2 green chilies, finely chopped
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 tomatoes, seeds removed and chopped
- 1 small bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ tsp Dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

### For Breading & Frying
- 2–3 eggs, beaten (for dredging)
- 1–1½ cups breadcrumbs (for coating)
- Vegetable oil, for shallow frying

## Method

### 1. Prep the Tuna and Veggies
- Drain the canned tuna well and place it in a large mixing bowl. Use a fork to flake it into smaller pieces, especially if using solid tuna.
- Cut the bread into chunks and pulse in a mini chopper to make fresh breadcrumbs. Add the crumbs to the bowl.
- Finely chop the onion, green chilies, garlic, and red bell pepper (a mini chopper works great for this), and add them in.
- Remove seeds from the tomatoes, chop them by hand (to avoid them turning mushy), and add to the bowl.
- Add chopped cilantro for a burst of freshness.

### 2. Season & Bind
- Add the juice of half a lemon, Dijon mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and pour them into the bowl.
- Mix everything gently but thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are well combined and the mixture holds together.

### 3. Shape & Bread the Tuna Cakes
- In a separate bowl, beat 2–3 eggs for dredging. Place breadcrumbs on a flat plate for coating.
- Using an ice cream scoop or your hands, portion out the tuna mixture into even balls. Flatten them slightly to form patties.
- Dip each patty first in the beaten eggs, then coat all over with breadcrumbs. Set aside on a plate.

### 4. Fry Until Golden
- Heat about ½ inch of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
- Fry tuna cakes in batches of 4, about 2–3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crisp on both sides.
- Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.

### 5. Serve & Enjoy!
- Arrange the crispy tuna cakes on a platter. Enjoy them hot, fresh, and bursting with color and flavor!
