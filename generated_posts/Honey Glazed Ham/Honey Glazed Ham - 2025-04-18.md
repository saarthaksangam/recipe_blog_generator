## Ingredients

### For the Ham & Roasting Pan
- 1 fully cooked, bone-in smoked ham (about 10 lbs; spiral cut or unsliced)
- 1 can pineapple slices (reserve 1 cup of the juice)
- 3–4 whole star anise

### For the Honey Glaze
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup reserved pineapple juice (from above)
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup honey (or maple syrup)
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves (freshly ground if possible)
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Ham & Pan
- If your ham is not spiral cut, use a sharp knife to score the surface in a diamond pattern (about 1/4-inch deep) all over. This helps the glaze seep into the meat.
- Line the bottom of a large roasting pan with pineapple slices. Place the ham cut-side down on top of the pineapple bed.
- Tuck star anise around the ham for extra aroma and flavor.

### 2. Make the Honey Glaze
- Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
- In a saucepan over low heat, melt 1/4 cup butter.
- Add 1 cup pineapple juice, 1 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.
- Stir well and increase the heat to medium-high. Simmer for 6–8 minutes, stirring constantly, until the glaze thickens and becomes syrupy.

### 3. Glaze and Bake the Ham
- Using a brush, generously baste the ham with about one-third of the glaze, getting into the scored cuts.
- Loosely cover the ham with aluminum foil and bake at 325°F (163°C) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 100°F (38°C).

### 4. Add Layers of Glaze & Caramelize
- Remove the ham from the oven and take off the foil.
- Increase oven temperature to 400°F (200°C).
- Baste the ham with half of the remaining glaze (warm it if needed), getting into all the nooks and crannies.
- Return the ham to the oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
- Baste with the last of the glaze and roast for another 10 minutes, uncovered, until deeply caramelized.

### 5. Rest and Serve
- Let the ham rest for at least 30 minutes before carving to retain its juices.
- Use the caramelized pineapple slices and pan drippings to serve alongside the ham for extra flavor.
