## Ingredients

### For the Ham

- 1 (10 lb) fully cooked, smoked, bone-in ham (spiral cut or whole, not pre-sliced)
- 1 can or ring of pineapple slices (reserve all the juice)
- 3–4 whole star anise (optional, for added flavor)

### For the Honey Glaze

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup reserved pineapple juice
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup honey (or substitute maple syrup)
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Ham & Tray

1. **Preheat the oven** to 325°F (163°C).
2. Remove all packaging from the ham.
3. If using a *whole* ham (not spiral cut), score the fat in a crosshatch (diamond) pattern, cutting about 1/4 inch deep — this helps the glaze penetrate.
4. Line the bottom of a large roasting pan or baking dish with pineapple slices. Pour in any juices from the pineapple can to flavor and moisten the ham as it bakes.
5. Place the ham *cut-side down* on top of the pineapple slices.
6. Scatter star anise around the ham for extra flavor.

### 2. Make the Honey Glaze

1. In a mortar and pestle, grind whole cloves if starting from whole, or simply measure out 1/4 tsp ground cloves.
2. In a saucepan over low heat, melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter.
3. Stir in 1 cup pineapple juice, 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 2 tbsp Dijon mustard, and 1/2 cup honey. Mix until smooth.
4. Add 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg.
5. Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil, stirring often.
6. Simmer for 6–8 minutes until the glaze thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir constantly to prevent burning.
7. Remove from heat. The glaze will thicken more as it cools.

### 3. Glaze and Bake the Ham

1. Generously brush about 1/3 of the glaze all over the surface of the ham, getting into the cuts and all around.
2. Loosely cover the ham with aluminum foil to retain moisture.
3. Bake in the preheated oven at 325°F (163°C) until the internal temperature of the ham reaches 100°F (38°C), about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. (Use a meat thermometer for best results.)

### 4. Caramelize and Finish

1. Remove the ham from the oven and take off the foil. Increase oven temperature to 400°F (200°C).
2. Brush with half of the remaining glaze, getting into all the cuts and over the top and sides.
3. Return the ham to the oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
4. Remove and brush with all the remaining glaze, making sure to coat every surface.
5. Bake once more, uncovered, for another 10 minutes, until the glaze is bubbly and caramelized.

### 5. Rest, Serve & Enjoy

1. Remove the ham from the oven and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. This keeps the meat juicy.
2. While resting, use the caramelized pineapple slices and pan drippings to garnish and serve.
3. Optional: Pour the pan drippings into a gravy boat to serve alongside the ham for extra flavor.
