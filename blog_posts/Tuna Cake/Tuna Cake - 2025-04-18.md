## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cake Mixture
- 3 cans solid white tuna (or flaky tuna or salmon), drained
- 3 slices fresh bread, for breadcrumbs
- ½ large onion, finely chopped
- 2 green chilies, finely chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ tsp Dijon mustard
- Salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

### For Breading & Frying
- 3 large eggs, beaten (for coating)
- Extra breadcrumbs (for coating)
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Tuna Mixture
- Drain the canned tuna thoroughly and empty it into a large mixing bowl.
- With a fork, break up the tuna so it’s flaky.
- Cut the bread into chunks and pulse in a mini chopper or food processor to make fresh breadcrumbs. Add them to the bowl with the tuna.

### 2. Chop the Vegetables
- Finely chop the onion; if you have a large onion, use just half.
- Roughly chop the green chilies and garlic, then pulse together in the chopper until finely minced. Add to the bowl.
- Roughly chop the red bell pepper and pulse in the chopper until fine. Add to the mix.
- Remove seeds from the tomatoes and finely chop them by hand to keep them firm. Add to the bowl.
- Finely chop the cilantro and add it in.

### 3. Season and Bind
- Add the juice of half a lemon, Dijon mustard, salt, and black pepper to the bowl.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and add them to the mixture.
- Gently mix everything together until evenly combined.

### 4. Shape and Bread the Tuna Cakes
- In a separate bowl, beat 3 eggs for coating.
- Place extra breadcrumbs in a shallow plate for coating.
- Using a trigger-release ice cream scoop (for even sizing) or your hands, portion out the tuna mixture and shape into round cakes.
- Dip each cake first in the beaten egg, then coat well in breadcrumbs. Set aside on a tray.

### 5. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
- Working in batches of four, add the tuna cakes to the hot oil.
- Fry until golden brown on one side, then flip and cook the other side (about 2–3 minutes per side).
- Once both sides are golden and crisp, remove and drain on a paper towel–lined plate.
