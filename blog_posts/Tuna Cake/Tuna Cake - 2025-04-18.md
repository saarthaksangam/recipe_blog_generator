Today on *Platin' It with Wendy*, we’re making Tuna Cakes — golden, crispy patties filled with tender tuna, fresh veggies, and just the right amount of spice. These vibrant cakes are packed with flavor, come together in minutes, and are perfect for a quick appetizer, lunch, or light dinner you'll love.

## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Cake Mixture
- 3 cans solid white tuna (drained; flaky tuna or even canned salmon can be used)
- 3 slices fresh bread (for breadcrumbs)
- ½ large onion
- 2 green chilies
- 5 garlic cloves
- ½ red bell pepper
- 2 medium tomatoes (seeds removed, chopped)
- 1 small bunch cilantro (finely chopped)
- Juice of ½ lemon
- ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 large eggs (lightly beaten)

### For Coating & Frying
- 3 large eggs (beaten, for dipping)
- Additional fresh breadcrumbs (from about 3 more slices of bread)
- Vegetable oil (for frying)

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Tuna and Vegetables
- Drain all the water from the canned tuna. Place tuna in a large mixing bowl and flake it using a fork or spoon until it’s evenly broken down.
- Make fresh breadcrumbs by cutting 3 slices of bread into cubes and pulsing them in a mini chopper or food processor until fine.
- Chop ½ large onion into chunks and pulse in the chopper until finely diced. Add to the bowl.
- Roughly chop 2 green chilies and 5 garlic cloves; pulse them together in the chopper until fine, then add to the bowl.
- Roughly chop ½ red bell pepper, pulse in the chopper, and add to the bowl.
- Remove seeds from 2 tomatoes, chop them by hand to keep them firm, and add to the bowl.
- Finely chop a small bunch of cilantro and add it in.

### 2. Season and Bind the Mixture
- Add the juice of ½ lemon, ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper to taste.
- Lightly beat 3 eggs and pour into the bowl.
- Mix all ingredients together until well combined. The mixture should hold together when pressed; if it feels too wet, add a little more breadcrumb.

### 3. Shape and Coat the Tuna Cakes
- In a separate bowl, beat 3 eggs for dipping.
- Prepare a plate with extra fresh breadcrumbs for coating.
- Using a trigger release ice cream scoop or your hands, portion the tuna mixture into equal balls. Flatten slightly into cakes.
- Dip each cake into beaten egg, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs. Set aside on a plate.

### 4. Fry the Tuna Cakes
- Heat a generous layer of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
- Fry the tuna cakes in batches of four, cooking each side until golden brown and crispy — about 2-3 minutes per side.
- Once golden and cooked through, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.
